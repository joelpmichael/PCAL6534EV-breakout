# PCAL6534EV Breakout

## What?

This is a breakout board for the NXP PCAL6534EV I2C GPIO expander. The board breaks out 32 out of the possible 34 GPIO pins, with 26 of the 32 GPIO pins arranged in a DIP-style layout at 12.7mm column spacing which is perfect for breadboard or protoboard use. There is also a SparkFun QUIIC-compatible connector, for easy connection to other QUIIC-compatible boards. Unfortunately, there just isn't enough room for any mounting holes.

## Why?

## How?

## Can I buy one?

Sure! Once I've got enough requests for a small batch run I'll send off an order. I test every single board to make sure it's fully functional before shipping.

## Can I make one?

Sure, why not? The board is designed to be manufactured using JLCPCB's 6-layer fabrication constraints as at March 2024 by using budget-size 50mm maximum dimension, standard 0.3mm drill size, 0.8mm thickness, 1oz outer copper, 0.5oz inner copper, and the JLC06081H-1080A stackup. It currently does not meet OSHPARK fabrication constraints, as the trace and space minimum is smaller than required.

## Can I make heaps and sell them?

Technically yes, but I'd love it if you gave me a cut in exchange for the testing system that I've developed.

## No really, why?

Shits and giggles: seeing who's both willing and able to manufacture the boards.
