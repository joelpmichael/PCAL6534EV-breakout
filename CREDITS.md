## Inspiration and hacks

### Andrew Zonenberg ([Fediverse](https://ioc.exchange/@azonenberg)) ([GitHub](https://github.com/azonenberg))

Thank you for getting me interested in doing my first FPGA design, which lead to me looking at the PCAL6534EV in the first place for power supply sequencing (this is a hint of my next project). Your mention of squashing BGA lands is the hack I'm trying here so I don't need to spend crazy amounts of money on 0.1mm laser vias.
